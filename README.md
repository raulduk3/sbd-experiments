# SBD Experimentation 
IPHS 484 Senior Seminar Projecy by Richard √Ålvarez

Shot boundary detection (SBD) is considered a substantial process of video browsing and retrieval. SBD aims to detect transition and their boundaries between consecutive shots; hence, shots with rich information are used in the content-based video indexing and retrieval.
